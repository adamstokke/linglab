LingLab README
==============


Overview
--------

<<<<<<< HEAD
LingLab is a system which allows for the description of the component aspects 
of a natural language. Its aim is to comprehensively model all salient 
constituents of natural language forms in a manner that is lingustically 
accurate while being easy to experiment with, code-wise.

The system itself simply undertakes to decompose supplied strings into 
linguistically analyzable components. User supplied strings of input in any 
manner of orthography are decomposed into phonemes, and thereafter into 
phonetic realizations if so desired. Strings of phonemes are recognized as 
lexemes that consist of morphemes, and can be represented and analyzed as such. Dictionaries of morphemes and lexemes can be orgranized into lexicons, and 
glosses obtained by supplying texts as input to a given language's set of 
lexicon data files (or objects in memory, etc.)

The aim is to make it relateively simple to describe any natural language (or 
constructed language, for that matter) and to work with this linguistic model. 
The author envisages this system being used to experiment with extant 
linguistics --- indeed, the project began as a way to represent spoken Navajo 
--- as well as a means to explore linguistic concepts in a programmatic manner.
 Enjoy!

System modules
--------------

* Phoneme.py: TODO
* Lexeme.py: most definitely TODO as this doesn't yet exist
* etc.
