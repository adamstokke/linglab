LingLab README
==============


Overview
--------

LingLab is a system which allows for the description of the component aspects of a natural language. Its aim is to comprehensively model all salient constituents of natural language forms in a manner that is lingustically accurate while being easy to experiment with, code-wise.

The system itself simply undertakes to decompose supplied strings into linguistically analyzable components. User supplied strings of input in any manner of **orthography** are decomposed into **phonemes**, and thence into** phonetic realizations** if so desired. Strings of phonemes are recognized as **lexemes** that consist of **morphemes**, and can be represented and analyzed as such. Dictionaries of morphemes and lexemes can be orgranized into **lexicons**, and **glosses** obtained by supplying texts as input to a given language's set of lexicon data files (or objects in memory, etc.)

The aim is to make it relateively simple to describe any natural language (or constructed language, for that matter). The author envisages this system being used to experiment with extant linguistics --- indeed, the project began as a way to represent spoken Navajo --- as well as a means to explore linguistic concepts in a programmatic manner. Enjoy!


System modules

* Phoneme.py: TODO
* Lexeme.py: most definitely TODO as this doesn't yet exist
* etc.
